This is my reasoning for the project Change-bg-color
first a button is created in html 
then it can either be styled or not but for mine it was stilled 
Then in javascript we refer the main items we will be changing or using in the const 
after that we set and array of colors of which the background can select and change to 
we Set the initial background color for the page
after that we set what happens then the button is clicked which is 
firstly the colors are randomized and set that one of the colors is selected when the button is clicked
